# BlackjackMachineLearning
This project analyzes data created by training an RL machine learning algorithm to play a simulation of blackjack. The website will allow the user to play blackjack, provide statistics for win probability of the current hand, and provide a recommendation for what move should be made next. There is further analysis documenting the optimal strategies based on the algorithm, win percentage tracked across 1 million simulations, and more.
